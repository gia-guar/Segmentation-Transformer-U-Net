### Callenges & what I'm learning
Due to hardware limitations, I could not fit the whole Dataset in the GPU, as I usually would, with tensorflow.data.Dataset. Data generators are much more light on RAM. Still the model is huge and I can only train batches of 16 elements. This will affect the performances, however, longer training could be a (time-consuming) alternative.

## Introduction
Lower-grade gliomas (LGG) are a group of WHO grade II and grade III brain tumors. As opposed
to grade I which are often curable by surgical resection, grade II and III are infiltrative and tend
to recur and evolve to higher-grade lesion. Predicting patient outcomes based on histopathological data for these tumors is inaccurate and suffers from inter-observer variability [1].
This dataset contains brain MR images together with manual FLAIR abnormality segmentation masks.
The images were obtained from The Cancer Imaging Archive (TCIA).
They correspond to 110 patients included in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) lower-grade glioma collection with at least fluid-attenuated inversion recovery (FLAIR) sequence and genomic cluster data available.

The images are then 3 different scans combined - T1, Flair and T1 contrast [2].

## U-Net Model
The model was chosen following the literature featuring this dataset [3] . It consist of a 4 layers ("floors") U-Net. It's not a small model, it is made of 10,655,809
Trainable params, for this reason, a high number of epochs is implmented. Callbacks will be put in place in future to prevent overfitting, however, the phenomenon was not observed after 100 training epochs. Learning reached a plateau after ~35 epochs on the validation set.

## Results and performances
The model shows decent results, however, it finds some difficulties when the shape of the glioma is irregular. Model history and more outputs can be found in this repository.

## Further imporvements
 - [ ] Implement DICE loss for better performances
 - [ ] compare FLAIR data with original pre-contrast + FLAIR + post-contrast data
 - [ ] add callback measures to prevent overfitting
 - [ ] ~~make a report on the original study [3] reproducibility~~ A BIGGER MODEL DOESN'T FIT ON GPU :(
